The scripts in this directory are executed after a git pull 
was done from inside the F1 dialog by the user.
The scripts must be named like 1.sh, 2.sh etc.
(You could use any name but numbers seems The Right Thing)
The script must be a Bash script and you must include "set -e"
to prevent cascading errors.
You should also include a single line echo command to let the
user know what's happening.

The script will run under the BT+ users' permissions.

Once a script is run it's name is stored inside 
~/.schoolsplay.rc/post_pull.
The program checks this file to see which scripts are runned before 
and checks to see if there are any newer scripts.
If it finds any scripts in this directory which aren't named in the 
post_pull file it will run it and send the any output to the dialog
in the F1 dialog.
